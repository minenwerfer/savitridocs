# Introduction

In order to better grasp Savitri concepts, you firstly have to be introduced to a small terminology that is featured on this documentation:

- entity: whether an `collection` or a `controllable`
- collection: something that is stored on the database
- controllable: something that provides functions
- function: an endpoint function
- context: `ApiContext`, or the second parameter of an endpoint function
