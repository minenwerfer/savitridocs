# Introduction

The package `@savitri/web` exists so that the frontend can take the maximum benefit from the backend resources. It's packaged separately so one can choose to use it alongside another UI library/framework as long as it is based on Vue (for Savitri reactivity is made on top of Pinia dependency, which relies on Vue internally).

It provides the following utilities:

- Stores management
- Internationalization
- Routing
